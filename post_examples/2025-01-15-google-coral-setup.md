I will guide you from a fresh rpi5 operating system to a working Google coral device. This method does not make use of Docker, I made Google Coral work with bare metal RPI5.<!--more--> In my case RPI is running `Raspberry pi OS Lite 64bit`. I'm using M.2 PCIe version of an accelerater, with [Pineboards hat](https://pineboards.io/products/hat-ai-for-raspberry-pi-5). I can't say this method will work with USB version too, but I don't see why it wouldn't.

## General info
To make the accelerator work we need 4 things
- gasket-dkms driver
- libedgetpu library
- Tensorflow Lite - needed by pycoral
- pycoral

Unfortunately google stopped updating the needed libraries leaving us with two options:

1. use the original version for old Tensorflow and python e.g. in Docker
2. use the newer version continued by the community

Regarding point one, I recommend the excellent [Jeff Geerling's blog post](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/pcie-coral-tpu-finally-works-on-raspberry-pi-5) he explains how to use Docker to make an “outdated” virtual machine inside rpi. The solution works but is not satisfactory for me. Looking for an alternative, I found the user [feranick](https://github.com/feranick/), who fixed bugs in the google repositories and built improved versions of gasket-dkms, libedgetpu and pycoral that work for the new version of Tensorflow (2.17) and python (3.11). All further instructions for point 2.

**Technical** <br>
The gray text in the code blocks (preceded by #) indicates a general comment illustrating the operation of the command. Below you will find the command for my case, it may differ from your command, so be careful. If the commands are split with newline run them one by one.

## Instructions
Before we start installing the drivers and libraries you need to make a few changes to the rp5 system. You can find detailed information and explanations of the run commands on the previously mentioned [Jeff's blog](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/pcie-coral-tpu-finally-works-on-raspberry-pi-5).

```bash
# Copy the entire block
sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt <<EOF
kernel=kernel8.img
dtparam=pciex1
dtparam=pciex1_gen=2
EOF

sudo sed -i '1 s/$/ pcie_aspm=off/' /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```
Reboot rpi
```
sudo reboot
```
To check if the correct kernel is loaded use
```
uname -a
```
We are only interested in the first part of `Linux rpi 6.6.51+rpt-rpi-v8` and specifically the value after the dash in my case `rpi-v8` means that `kernel8` was loaded correctly. Now we change the `device-tree`, original instruction [available here](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/how-customize-dtb-device-tree-binary-on-raspberry-pi)
```bash
# we create a backup dtb
sudo cp /boot/firmware/bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb /boot/firmware/bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb.bak

# Decompiles dtb (ignore errors)
dtc -I dtb -O dts /boot/firmware/bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb -o ~/test.dts

# Modify the file
nano ~/test.dts
```
Now search for the lines `msi-parent = <0x2f>` e.g. using `Crl+Q` and typing the phrase. You should find yourself in the section labeled `pcie@110000` scroll down and note the value of `phandle` (on the bottom). Enter the value of `phandle` to the value of `msi-parent`. In my case:
![]({{ "assets/images/coral-1.png" | relative_url }})
The value of `phandle` is `0x68`. Now we replace the `msi-parent` value with the `phandle` value.
![]({{ "assets/images/coral-2.png" | relative_url }})
we exit by saving the file with `Ctrl+X`, `Y`, `Enter`. The last step is to recompile the tree.
```bash
dtc -I dts -O dtb ~/test.dts -o ~/test.dtb
sudo mv ~/test.dtb /boot/firmware/bcm2712-rpi-5-b.dtb
```
If an error appears `mv: failed to preserve ownership` ignore it.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

#### Phew the worst is over

Of course, if rpi reboots...
We can move on to installing libraries.

```bash
sudo apt install git python3-pip
```

Now we will be downloading files so choose the folder in which you want to store them. Since I used os lite version I have to additionally create a folder in my case `Documents`.

```bash
# mkdir <LOCATION> && cd <LOCATION>
mkdir Documents && cd Documents/
```
Here are the necessary binary files that we will be downloading in the next step:
- [Revised version of libedgetpu library](https://github.com/feranick/libedgetpu)
- [Updated Tensorflow Lite](https://github.com/feranick/TFlite-builds)
- [Revised version of pycoral library and finished whl files](https://github.com/feranick/pycoral)
- [Updated version of gasket-dkms driver](https://github.com/feranick/gasket-driver)

At the time of writing this tutorial, I am using the latest release for TF 2.17. In the future, see if a newer version is available.
```bash
wget https://github.com/feranick/libedgetpu/releases/download/16.0TF2.17.1-1/libedgetpu1-std_16.0tf2.17.1-1.bookworm_arm64.deb

wget https://github.com/feranick/TFlite-builds/releases/download/v2.17.1/tflite_runtime-2.17.1-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl

wget https://github.com/feranick/pycoral/releases/download/2.0.3TF2.17.1/pycoral-2.0.3-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl

wget https://github.com/feranick/gasket-driver/releases/download/1.0-18.2/gasket-dkms_1.0-18.2_all.deb
```
Now install the downloaded `gasket-dkms` and `libedgetpu` libraries.

```bash
# sudo apt install <./gasket-dkms> <./libedgetpu1-std>.
sudo apt install ./gasket-dkms_1.0-18.2_all.deb ./libedgetpu1-std_16.0tf2.17.1-1.bookworm_arm64.deb
```
Now we add our user to a new group `apex` to avoid problems with accessing the accelerator without `sudo`.
```bash
sudo sh -c “echo ‘SUBSYSTEM=”apex“, MODE=”0660“, GROUP=”apex"’ >> /etc/udev/rules.d/65-apex.rules”

sudo groupadd apex

sudo adduser $USER apex
```
Then restart the system
```bash
sudo reboot
```
To check if the drivers are working
```bash
ls /dev/apex_0
```
The expected result is that there is no error about invalid location. Now let's see if there are any other errors.
```bash
dmesg | grep apex
```
The expected result
```bash
[5.558661] apex 0000:01:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
[10.813764] apex 0000:01:00.0: Apex performance not throttled due to temperature 
```
Now in the documents we create a python virtual environment and activate it 
```
cd Documents

python3 -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
```
We install the previously downloaded python libraries.
```bash
# pip install <./tflite_runtime>.
pip install ./tflite_runtime-2.17.1-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl

# pip install <./pycoral>
pip install ./pycoral-2.0.3-cp311-cp311-linux_aarch64.whl
```
If you get the error `ERROR: ... is not a supported wheel on this platform` go to [troubleshooting section](#uncompatible-versions-of-python-libraries).

Since the pycoral library requires numpy < 2.0 we need to downgrade it
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
```

## Check if it works
[Original instructions](https://coral.ai/docs/m2/get-started#4-run-a-model-on-the-edge-tpu)

```bash
mkdir coral && cd coral

git clone https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral.git

cd pycoral

bash examples/install_requirements.sh classify_image.py

python3 examples/classify_image.py }
--model test_data/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_inat_bird_quant_edgetpu.tflite }
--labels test_data/inat_bird_labels.txt }
--input test_data/parrot.jpg
```

You should see results like this:
```bash
INFO: Initialized TensorFlow Lite runtime.
----INFERENCE TIME----
Note: The first inference on Edge TPU is slow because it includes loading the model into Edge TPU memory.
11.8ms
3.0ms

```

If it returns the error `ValueError: Failed to load delegate from libedgetpu.so.1` go to [troubleshooting section](#failed-to-load-delegate-from-libedgetpuso1).

## Troubleshooting
#### Incompatible versions of python libraries
```bash
ERROR: tflite_runtime-2.17.1-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.
```
The `cp312` fragment means that this is a library for python 312 (3.12) and the `linux_aarch64` fragment indicates the architecture type.

The error indicates a mismatch between the python version in the environment and the library version. Go to the linked repositories and download the files corresponding to your python version or CPU architecture.
- [Corrected version of libedgetpu library](https://github.com/feranick/libedgetpu/releases)
- [Tensorflow Lite binaries](https://github.com/feranick/TFlite-builds/releases)
- [Revised version of pycoral library and ready-made whl files](https://github.com/feranick/pycoral/releases)
- [Updated version of gasket-dkms driver](https://github.com/feranick/gasket-driver/releases) 

#### Failed to load delegate from libedgetpu.so.1
This could mean that:
1. the accelerator is incorrectly/not connected
2. some error in the detection of the accelerator
3. wrong permissions

Check `dmesg | grep apex`.
```bash
[5.267530] apex 0000:01:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
[5.268361] apex 0000:01:00.0: Couldn't initialize interrupts: -28
[10.298291] apex 0000:01:00.0: Apex performance not throttled due to temperature    
```
if you find the line `Couldn't initialize interrupts` then you have incorrectly executed the first part of the instruction (aka point 2) and the rpi is not communicating properly with the accelerator. I suggest to start from the beggining...
   
otherwise it is most likely an permission error. That is, the group is created incorrectly / you do not belong to it. You can install the libraries globally and try to run the script with the preceding `sudo`.
   
to proceed with the analysis in other cases follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/google-coral/edgetpu/issues/611#issuecomment-1155692403). I wish you good luck!
